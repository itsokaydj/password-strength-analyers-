# Password Strength Analyzer

## Overview
The **Password Strength Analyzer** is a Python-based application designed to evaluate the strength of passwords and provide actionable suggestions for improving their security. This tool employs criteria such as length, character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters), and usability to classify passwords as *Strong*, *Moderate*, or *Weak*. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with the `tkinter` library, offering a user-friendly way to check password security.

## Features
1. **Password Strength Analysis**:
   - Evaluates passwords based on criteria like length, character diversity, and the inclusion of special characters.
   - Classifies passwords as:
     - **Strong**: Meets all security criteria.
     - **Moderate**: Partially meets criteria with room for improvement.
     - **Weak**: Lacks essential characteristics.

2. **Actionable Suggestions**:
   - Provides personalized feedback to improve the security of weak or moderate passwords.

3. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
   - A simple and intuitive interface using the `tkinter` library.
   - Includes a *Show/Hide Password* toggle button to enhance usability.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `tkinter`: For creating the GUI.
  - `re` (Regular Expressions): For validating password criteria.

## Installation and Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of running Python scripts.

### Steps to Run the Application
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/password-strength-analyzer.git
   cd password-strength-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install Python**:
   Ensure Python 3.x is installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the Python script in your terminal or IDE:
   ```
   python password_analyzer.py
   ```

4. **Interact with the Application**:
   - Enter your password in the GUI.
   - Click **Analyze** to evaluate the password strength.
   - View the result and suggestions for improvement.

## How It Works
1. **Password Analysis**:
   - The `analyze_password` function evaluates passwords against five criteria:
     - Minimum length of 8 characters.
     - Presence of uppercase letters.
     - Presence of lowercase letters.
     - Inclusion of numbers.
     - Use of special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*()`).

2. **GUI Interaction**:
   - The GUI allows users to:
     - Input their passwords.
     - Toggle password visibility using the **Show Password** button.
     - View suggestions for improving password strength in real-time.

## Example Scenarios
### Input: `abc123`
- **Output**: Weak
- **Suggestions**:
  - Increase the length to at least 8 characters.
  - Include uppercase letters and special characters.

### Input: `Abc123`
- **Output**: Moderate
- **Suggestions**:
  - Add special characters to strengthen the password.

### Input: `Abc123!@#`
- **Output**: Strong
- **Suggestions**: None, the password meets all criteria.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Real-Time Analysis**:
   - Analyze password strength dynamically as the user types.

2. **Password Generation**:
   - Integrate a feature to generate strong, random passwords.

3. **Advanced Security Checks**:
   - Detect and warn against common or dictionary-based passwords.

4. **Multi-Language Support**:
   - Translate the interface and feedback for a global audience.
